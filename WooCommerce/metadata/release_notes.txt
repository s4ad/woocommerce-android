This release contains a helpful feature for merchants looking to record a quick monetary transaction that we call simple payments. Quickly take an in-person credit card payment or send your customer a payment link to your site!

You’ll also see we changed the tabs a bit and added a “More” tab. Store settings and a few other things were moved there to prepare for more features!
